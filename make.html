        <p>NFT lending adds many exciting scenarios to how people invest and generate income from their NFTs. As such, it could be a game-changer for NFT holders and traders alike. While NFT owners can earn income without selling their holdings, lenders can access new investment opportunities. As the NFT sector expands, we may see NFT lending models mature or evolve to provide a better loaning experience.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><h3>Peer-to-peer (P2P) NFT lending</h3>
          <br>
          <p>Under this model, borrowers and lenders are matched on peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms that use a simple offer system. An owner lists their NFT on the platform and receives loan offers from interested parties. Once a match is made, the NFT is put into an escrow vault until the loan is repaid or expires. If the NFT owner defaults on the loan, the NFT is transferred to the money lender's wallet, usually through a smart contract.</p></li><br>
          
          <li><h3>Peer-to-protocol NFT lending</h3>
          <br>
          <p>With peer-to-protocol NFT lending platforms, users can collateralize their NFTs and borrow directly from the protocol. In exchange, they will receive funds from liquidity providers that add funds (usually crypto) to a protocol pool. Under a peer-to-protocol NFT lending model, the liquidity providers are technically the borrowers of the collateralized NFT and earn interest as such.<br>
          
          Unlike P2P NFT lending, what’s being monitored here is not a deadline but the health factor of the NFT loan – essentially, the difference in collateralized market value and outstanding loan amount. As soon as the health factor falls below a threshold, the asset is typically transferred to the protocol. Depending on the platform, the NFT owner may be afforded a grace period to repay their loan to claim the NFT back.</p></li><br>
          
          <li><h3>Non-fungible debt positions</h3>
          <p>Under this model, a unique digital asset representing a loan agreement, known as a non-fungible debt position (NFDP), is created. The NFDP is secured and stored on a blockchain like BNB Smart Chain or Ethereum and acts as a transparent record of the loan agreement, ensuring that the terms are not altered.
          <br>
          In addition, the NFDP can be traded on a secondary market; ownership of the digital asset can switch hands easily, providing a more flexible way for users to exit an investment or leverage their current NFDP asset.</p></li><br>
          
          <li><h3>NFT rental</h3>
          <p>NFT rentals are slightly different from the conventional lending models as the main aim for renters isn’t interest but the perks associated with the NFT, be it community or club membership or the right to receive exclusive merchandise. Since the main utility extracted from such NFTs is non-monetary, NFT rental agreements usually come without repayment terms, interest, or liquidation. <br>
          
          Instead, a collateralized NFT is transferred to another wallet for a fixed period in exchange for crypto funds. The asset is returned to the NFT owner at the end of the period. Meanwhile, the renter enjoys access to the benefits associated with the particular NFT. </p></li>
